# Tableau-Coffee-Profitability-Analysis
This Tableau Coffee Profitability Analysis project analyzes and visualizes a coffee chain's financial data. The goal of this project was to figure out why the coffee chain was not profiting. When going into more detail, it's 3 main issues were products/locations, inventory management, and marketing expenses. 

In the powerpoint presentation, there is an in depth explanation of my findings and recommendations to make the coffee chain profitable. 

The recommendation I suggested was for the chain to stop selling California’s amaretto and decaf Irish cream, New York’s caffe mocha and mint, and Nevada’s green tea since these were costing them money. I also suggested they put money into other products' inventories since the ones previously mentioned do not benefit the company. Lastly, they need to cut marketing expenses on the products mentioned and reallocate them to other products.

The dashboard shows the profitability by state and profitability by product. The darker the shade, the more profitable the state is.
